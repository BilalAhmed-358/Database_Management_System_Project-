# Introduction

A full stack "port management system" project made for our Database and Management Systems course, it would involve the development of a web application that can manage the various operations of a port such as tracking the arrival and departure of ships, managing cargo, and maintaining inventory.

## Tech Stack

### Front End:
a. HTML
b. CSS
c. Bootstrap
d. Javascript

The front-end of the project would be developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, which would ensure a visually appealing and responsive user interface. 

### Back End:
a. Php

The back-end of the project would be developed using PHP, which would be responsible f or processing data and performing server-side operations. 

### Database:
a. MySQL

The project would use MySQL as the database management system, which would ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data.

# Functionality Description

Users would be able to register and log in to the system to access different features, such as adding and editing cargo information, scheduling shipments, and generating reports. The system would also provide real-time information about the location and status of ships, helping to improve the efficiency of port operations.
Overall, the project would be a comprehensive solution to manage all aspects of port operations, making it easier for port managers to keep track of cargo, shipments, and vessels.
